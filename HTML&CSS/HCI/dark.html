    <h1>Short Story</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time, in a village known to many as <i>Ikuywa</i>, lived one old grizzled man. He was
    always happy despite being old and beat </p>
    <p>Nobody knew anything about him and since he was poor, Nobody dared to ask him about his whereabouts</p>
    <p>That village had a lot of rich people who had compounds enclosed by electric fences and high walls
        The old man never bothered about his security since he thought nobody would even bother him since he had noothing to offer

    </p>
    <p>On this day, a young man, who seemingly had came to visit a relative, passed near the old man's crib
    He had heard stories that old men had entertaining stories and he also wanted to have a glimpse of it.
    He knocked gently on the semi open door and a frisky but joyous voice ushered him in.
    He entered in happily and sat on the floor ready to listen to the story. Unfortunately the old
    man closed the door and I being the paparazzi did not get a glimpse.
