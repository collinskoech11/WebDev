     <h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Makina Baptist Church began in <b>1987</b> as a common cell-group by <b>Missionary Lynn Raburn</b><img src="lynn.jpeg" alt=""> 
and <b>Pastor James Muhanji</b> along Kabarnet road.</p>
<p>It later shifted to <b>Kibera,Makina</b> 
near <b>Kibera law courts</b> in <b>1988.</b></p>
<p>Unfortunately the Kibera Law Courts wanted to expound on its space and the church had already grown 
therefore it was allocated its current location in <b>Kichinjio Area</b> <i>
(it was called so because there was a cattle slaughter house by then)</i> 
by then<b> Chief Kosgei.</b></p>
<p><b>Pastor James Muhanji</b> and <b>Pastor Shivoka</b> with other church members 
joined hands to construct the church at its present location in <b>1989</b></p>
<p>Then <b>Missionary Raburn</b> departed hence leading to arrival of <b>Missionary Hopper
</b> <img src="hopper.jpeg"> who aided in construction of the church that is currently up with the leadership of <b>
Pastor Walter Matete</b> who is currently serving at <b>First Landmark Baptist Church,Satellite
</b></p>
<p><b>Pastor Matete</b> served untill <b>1994</b></p>
<p>During the leadership of <b>Pastor Matete</b> the church began a <b>Sunday School</b> 
for the kids and later on it grew to a <b>Primary School</b> which operated untill 
<b>2019</b> where it collapsed.</p>
<p><b>Pastor Matete</b> was taken over by <b>Pastor Evans Jumba</b> who served from 
<b>1995</b> to <b>2008</b></p>
<p><b>Pastor Evans Jumba</b> lead to growth of cellgroups which were basically for visiting 
each other and encouraging brethren</p>
<p>The cell-groups are:

<p><b style="color: red;list-style: none;">Olympics</b> led by Charles Obes and Mabel Indasi</p>
</p>
</p>
<p>During his time <b>Pastor Evans Jumba</b> and other church members sent <b>Missionary John Wanyonyi</b> to <b>Southern Sudan,Kapoeta</b> with a mission of starting churches and christianity to the youngest country </p>
<p>This was a success since it lead to growth of Churches in Kapoeta,Nachikut and others</p>
<p>Later <b>Pastor Elijah Mahindu</b> took the leadership from <b>2008</b> to <b>2012</b></p>
<p>Under the leadership of <b>Pastor Elijah Mahindu</b> the <b>First youth camp </b> 
was hosted in Makina Baptist Church in <b>2011, August 28<sup>th</sup></b> with 
<b>Patrick Abuti</b> as the youth leader.</p>
